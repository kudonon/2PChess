This project is a basic 2-player Chess game that is coded
procedural format (with minimal object oriented programming)

In a console, the project asks for input for Player 1,
then Player 2, and so on till the game ends.

Since this is an ovrsimplified way of programming a Chess game
made for APCS class, it has some modifications from the original game

For example, the program does not check for a checkmate. Instead, 
it tells the users when a king is in check, but to win the game, 
the king must be taken down and not checkmated.

Just Run Main.java on a console (terminal/shell) and 

Enjoy!
